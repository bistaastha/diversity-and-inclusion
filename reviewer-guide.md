# Reviewer Guide

## Working with checklists

A CHAOSS Badging application starts when an Applicant opens a Pull Request on either the [event](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion) or the [project](https://github.com/badging/project-diversity-and-inclusion) badging repository. They fill out a PR template at the beginning of the PR, which contains the information a reviewer looks at. Upon being assigned that Pull Request, a checklist in the form of a comment is generated with the name of the reviewer in it.

During a review, a Reviewer would analyse the information given by an Applicant using the Review Checklist. There are separate checklists for both [Event](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/checklist.md) and [Project](https://github.com/badging/project-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/master/.github/checklist.md) reviews.

## Guidelines

  - Make sure the Initial checks are met. These are the basic requirements which help to ensure that the application is at a bare minimum standard.
  - Mark your observations according to the Review Checklist, and give feedback on how an application can be improved if certain checks are not met.
  - If you have feedback outside of the scope of what the review checklist asks for, create a new comment informing the applicant about that.
